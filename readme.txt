== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add more counter Images? =

You can add new counter image styles by creating a new folder within `/wp-content/plugins/Mechanic-Visitor-Counter-main/styles/image/`. The folder name will be the style name. Each style folder must contain image files named `0.gif`, `1.gif`, ..., `9.gif`.

= How to add language? =

Since version 3.1, the plugin supports localization. To contribute a translation, please use the `.pot` file (if available) or copy and translate the `languages/wp-statsmechanic-en_GB.po` file. Save your translation as `Mechanic-Visitor-Counter-main-{locale}.po` (e.g., `Mechanic-Visitor-Counter-main-es_ES.po`) and compile the `.mo` file. Place both files in the `languages` directory. You can also contact the original author at me@adityasubawa.com.
